* The git I was struggling with was pull. Not using it a lot because of solo challanges has made it hard to get a great concept of it in my mind.

* Pull was explained a little bit better. I am still a tad confused

* So many damn questions. This was helped out by my instructor.

* Pull is still really hard for me to grasp.

* Not bad, needs more cowbell.
