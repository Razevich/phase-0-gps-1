* What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Creating and merging branches was difficult for me, as well going through the correct steps to pull and push requests.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Creating and deleting branches were clarified. As well as the git workflow. And I am slightly more clear on pull and push requests but I do get confused.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We both asked a lot of questions about the Git workflow regarding pull and push requests and branches.

* What still confuses you about Git?

Git Push and Pull Requests as well as branches.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Colin and Michael we're great. They were very nice and helped me solidify my knowledge. Looking forward to the rest of my pairing sessions now!
